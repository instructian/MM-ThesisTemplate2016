\chapter{Discussion}
This is where you interpret the results. What was successful and why. For negative \& ambiguous results - analyze. Are there problems in the testing instrument? With the methods? With the thesis question? Examine the final aesthetics? Describe the process of testing and fine tuning.

\item If project succeeds, is there anything you would do differently? How would extend the project? Is there something you wish you had done and the reason you didn't do it.
\item If project failed (or didn't meet expectations), why? What alternatives might have worked? How does your experience map to your initial self-assessment in section 1.1? What did you learn from this failure?
\item What was your experience of working together as a team? What did you learn? What would you do differently?
\end {itemize}
