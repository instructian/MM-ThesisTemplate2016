\chapter{Detailed Project Development and Methods}

\begin{itemize}
\item Content (describe theme, flow or narration, structure, user control, etc.)
\item Technology
    \begin{itemize}
	\item Computing hardware (define minimum requirements)
    \item Software (OS, application language, development process, libraries)
	\item Graphics/Video
	\item Projection and Physical Space
    \item Other 
    \end{itemize}
\item Design
\item Implementation Process
\item History of development of Content and Technology (eg history of research -- what options were tested and discarded? why? Donâ€™t cover every\cite{shannon-weaver} minor twist, turn or drama -- only include lessons learned that others could benefit from). Perhaps add a schematic of project design
\end{itemize}
