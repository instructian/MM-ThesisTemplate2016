\chapter{Results}
Describe results thoroughly. Report raw results, not interpretation. Results will include what you got to work, and, to the extent that you used an iterative process for development, the specific results of the process. Good results (ie, those that support your thesis question) are OK. Bad results are OK. Mixed results are OK. But vague or unclear results, no results, or mushy waffle instead of results is not.
